	<p>My name is Mark Pereira. I work as an Adverting Executive at Whole Wheat Creative, an ad firm in the Heights. At Whole Wheat, I work as the account lead for Living Water International, Camp Ozark, Battleship Texas Foundation, as well as several of our smartphone applciation accounts.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I spend a lot of time planning the Full of Grace 5K. I started Full of Grace two years ago in honor of my mom, who passed away from ovarian cancer. The run, which takes place every February, raises money for ovarian cancer research at MD Anderson Cancer Center. To find out more information about the run, click <a href="http://www.fullofgrace5k.com"><strong>here</strong>.</a></p>
